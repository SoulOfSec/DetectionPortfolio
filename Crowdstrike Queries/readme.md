## CrowdStrike Falcon Detections & Queries

This folder contains a collection of **FQL (Falcon Query Language)**–based detections and threat hunting queries I developed to identify suspicious behaviors within Windows and hybrid environments.  
Each query aligns with **MITRE ATT&CK** techniques and focuses on **real-world adversary tradecraft**.

## Objective

Build **reusable and modular Falcon queries** to:
- Detect **lateral movement**, **persistence**, and **defense evasion** activity  
- Support **threat hunting** and **incident response investigations**  
- Integrate with automated enrichment and dashboards (Power BI, XSIAM, etc.)
